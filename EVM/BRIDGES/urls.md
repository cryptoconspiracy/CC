# Summary

Each bridge serves different ecosystems, fee models, and privacy needs.  
Always verify:

- Supported networks  
- Transaction fees  
- Estimated arrival time  
- Security of the protocol  

Each bridge serves different ecosystems, fee models, and privacy needs.  
To reduce risks and ensure smooth transfers:

### **Always verify the available liquidity on the bridge before executing a large transfer.**  
Low liquidity can cause delays, failed swaps, or unfavorable rates.

### **Always start with a small test transaction before sending your full amount.**  
A quick test confirms that the bridge, chain, and wallet are communicating correctly.

This list helps choose the right tool for every cross-chain scenario while maintaining best safety practices.
