### ⚠ Security Reminders  
- **Dashboards are for viewing only** — never deposit or transfer assets into them.  
- Always verify permissions before connecting your wallet.  
- Never enable auto-compounding unless you fully trust the protocol and understand the smart contract risks.

These dashboards are meant to enhance visibility—never custody—over your assets.
