# Crypto Cards — Country of Origin, CARF Status, and Regulatory Outlook

All official URLs provided earlier are included.

# 1. What is CARF?

CARF (Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework) is the OECD’s new global standard for **automatic international tax reporting for crypto-assets**.

Countries implement CARF in three waves:

- **2027** — Brazil, EU, Cayman Islands, Poland, etc.  
- **2028** — Hong Kong, Seychelles, Canada  
- **2029** — United States  

Once CARF is active in a jurisdiction, centralized crypto services, custodial wallets, MSBs, and payment processors will be required to report user activity to tax authorities.

# 2. Country Mapping for Each Crypto Card  
(Updated: **Kast** and **Ether.fi Card are separate products**)

|----------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|-----|-------|
| **Ether.fi Card** | **Cayman Islands** (EtherFi Foundation) | Committed | **2027** | https://www.ether.fi/refer/f58c51f4 | Early adopter; high likelihood of future CARF reporting. |
| **Kast Card** | **Hong Kong** (Kast Finance HK) | Committed | **2028** | https://kastfinance.app.link/469U93TI | Separate product from Ether.fi; HK reports starting 2028. |

# 3. Detailed Breakdown

---

## 3.1 **Ether.fi Card (NOT Kast)**  
**URL:** https://www.ether.fi/refer/f58c51f4  
**Jurisdiction:** **Cayman Islands**  
**CARF Start:** **2027**  

- EtherFi Foundation is incorporated in **Cayman Islands**.  
- Cayman is part of the **first CARF wave**, starting 2027.  
- Very high probability that Ether.fi Card activity will eventually be reportable.  

Ether.fi Card ≠ Kast — this was corrected.

---

## 3.2 **Kast Card (Separate Product)**  
**URL:** https://kastfinance.app.link/469U93TI  
**Jurisdiction:** **Hong Kong (Kast Finance HK)**  
**CARF Start:** **2028**  

Kast is *not* EtherFi. They are independent fintech/crypto card ecosystems.

- Hong Kong begins CARF exchanges in 2028.  
- Kast is expected to fall under CARF once HK implements local guidance.  
- Popular travel perks: insurance, lounge access, hotel discounts, cashback.  

---

## 3.3 Spritz  
**URL:** https://spritz.link/r/aa0ie7  
**Jurisdiction:** United States  
**CARF Start:** 2029

- US enters CARF last.  
- As a regulated MSB-enabled service, reporting is likely once CARF is implemented domestically.

---

## 3.4 Picnic (Uses Gnosis Card — EU Issuer)  
**URL:** https://usepicnic.com/app/referral/claim?ref=675ARX  
**Jurisdiction:**  
- **Brazil (front-end app)**  
- **European Union (Gnosis Pay = licensed issuer)**  
**CARF Start:** 2027 (both BR + EU)

This is one of the **most CARF-visible cards**, due to double early-adopter jurisdictions.

---

## 3.5 RedotPay  
**URL:** https://url.hk/i/en/gs8sy  
**Jurisdiction:** Hong Kong  
**CARF Start:** 2028

---

## 3.6 Offramp  
**URL:** https://app.offramp.xyz/login?referralCode=2sbz4j  
**Jurisdiction:** Poland (EU)  
**CARF Start:** 2027

EU will enforce CARF very strictly.

---

## 3.7 KazePay  
**URL:** https://app.kazepay.io/pages/r?c=srHXXVG9  
**Jurisdiction:** United States  
**CARF Start:** 2029

---

## 3.8 SolCard  
**URL:** https://solcard.cc/r/conspiracy  
**Jurisdiction:** Undisclosed  
**CARF Start:** — (cannot be mapped)

This is the only opaque card in the list.

---

# 4. CARF Transparency Ranking (Practical View)

### **Highest transparency (2027)**  
- Ether.fi Card (Cayman)  
- Picnic (BR + EU)  
- Offramp (EU/Poland)

### **Mid transparency (2028)**  
- Kast (Hong Kong)  
- RedotPay (Hong Kong)

### **Delayed transparency (2029)**  
- Spritz (US)  
- KazePay (US)

### **Unknown / opaque**  
- SolCard

# 5. Final Notes

CARF will transform crypto card regulation globally.  
Most cards in this list operate in CARF-committed jurisdictions and will become reportable once their countries enact domestic CARF laws.

This document will be updated as jurisdictions move from **commitment → legislation → enforcement**.
